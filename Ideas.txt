1) make collision function work properly and remove any need for Planet.RECT (delete it)

2) calculate the gravity based on the following idea:

1]divide all objects into groups of 2, and calculate their center of mass based upon their distance and masses and add to the netforce 
2] now do the same for all the groups of objects till only 1 net force value is left to add
3] based upon the distance between each obj/center of mass, their netforce addition will decrease,ie) higher distance = lower netforce addition 

3) Create a 3d simulation on a 2d plane by changing all vector2 to vector3 and drawing the circles using a visibleradius variable which decrease the further away from 0 the Z axis is and change all the calculations to work with a vector3

end-point ideas (implent after completing the project)

1) Using the Schwarzschild radius formual immediately convert a planet into a new object if it meets thr critera (Current R >= Schwarzschild radius,calculated using mass )
